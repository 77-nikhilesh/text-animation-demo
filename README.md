# Text Animation Demo

This is a demo to showcase a unique text animation effect, where words like **Coder**, **Programmer**, **Developer**, and **Designer** scroll smoothly in a loop, showcasing the versatility of roles in the tech world.

## How It Works:
The animation is achieved using CSS `@keyframes` and a combination of `transform` properties, which makes the text scroll from one word to the next in a continuous loop.

## Demo:
You can view the live demo of the animation at:

## Customization:
- You can easily modify the words in the animation by editing the HTML content inside the `<h2>` tags.
- Adjust the speed of the animation by modifying the `animation` duration in the CSS.
